# Risk Assessment

Performing a risk assessment is an important step in being prepared for potential problems that can occur during the development of the project. During the risk assessment, if a potential risk is identified, a solution or plan of action should be developed. The following is a list of potential project risks. Each risk that receives a high score should have a corresponding plan for management and control of the risk. The criteria that are applied when selecting the appropriate risk level are as follows:

 - **Low** - Very unlikely that this will occur during the development of the project
 - **Medium** - There is a 50/50 chance that this will occur during the development of the project
 - **High** - Very likely that this will occur during the development of the project

## Possible Risks

1. The hardware or software chosen to do the project can't handle the workload required to complete the project. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Choose appropriate hardware or software that would be able to handle the workload required to complete the project.

	  
2. The cost of labor, support costs and other charges aren't within the budget and will increase year to year. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Temporary staffing and reducing unnecessary charges can help avoid this risk. In this case such measures are not necessary.

	
3. We do not have enough resources / manpower and the project team members aren't in place when required. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Create a clear and concise plan that would specify the resources needed as well as role of each team members. 

	
4. The requirements have not been gathered and defined adequately. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to the project, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.

	
5. The requirements are continually changing. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The requirements should be documented and defined clearly before the start of the project to avoid any changes.

	
6. The project will not be completed on time. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Carefully planning milestones and working to reach the milestone on time should allow the project to be completed on time.
	
	
7. There is no correct platform for testing and modeling. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Identifying what aspects of design are testable and with what parameters those tests work during the design phase should help us choose the correct platform for testing and modeling.
	
	
8. The system requires continuous maintenance and debugging. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Adjusting the mix of reactive, preventive, predictive, and proactive maintenance strategies so we can focus on doing the right things at the right time could mitigate many of these problems. 
	
	 
9. The project has not been planned carefully and does not have a vision document. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Planning the project correctly and having a Vision Document is always beneficial for the health of the project.
	
	
10. We do not have experienced team members and the work has not been divided correctly. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Having an experienced team member/leader will prevent the project from straying. Also the work should be divided appropriately focusing on each team member's strengths and weaknesses to avoid any risk associated with it.
	
	
11. The user interface is not correct, clear, and easy to use. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Create a clear and easy to use interface during the design phase.  Involving the coffee cart owner during the development of the project and getting approvals on all the design iterations should help avoid this risk.
	
	
12.  The system is affected when more customers are added as members. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Server might crash due to more users, the pre-determined number of request queue should be adjusted to accommodate all of the customers and to avoid the above risk.
	
	
13.  The compilers or code generators available are not appropriate for the system to be built. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The compilers and code generators necessary should be identified during the requirements/design phase. The appropriate one should be chosen during the development of the project.
	
	 
14. The testing tools available are not appropriate for the system to be built. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Identifying what aspects of design are testable and with what parameters those tests work, during the design phase should help us choose the correct platform for testing and modeling.
	
	
15. The formal technical reviews of test procedures and test cases are not conducted regularly. **(Medium Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The formal technical review of test procedures and test cases should be conducted regularly because it increases test coverage and therefore improves the product quality.
	
	
16. A delay in one deliverable causes cascading delays in the completion of the project. **(High Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - Each deliverable should be completed on time allowing enough time for the planning and execution of the other deliverables.
	
	
17.  The compilers or code generators available are not appropriate for the product to be built. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The compilers and code generators necessary should be identified during the requirements/design phase. The appropriate one should be chosen during the development of the project.
	
	
18. The software configuration management tools are not available. **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The software configuration management tools helps to establish and maintain consistency of a product's performance, functional and physical attributes with its requirements, design and operational information throughout its life. There are several open source configuration management tool that could be used for this project.
	
	
19. The End-user input is not solicited, causing ultimate failure of the product and to meet user expectations. **(Low Risk)**
				
	**Mitigation** - When gathering requirements and goals, it is important to include the end user (owner) in the process. The end-user who will eventually use the software and will have the most pertinent input regarding the features it should include. In this project however, we play the roles of both the programmer and the end-user.
	
	
20. The requirements demand the use of new analysis, design, or testing methods and  use of unconventional software development methods? **(Low Risk)**

	**Mitigation** - The requirements should be reviewed and improvements should be made like clarifying objectives, adjusting expected results or indicators, adjusting assumptions to avoid using unconventional software development methods.
