# Coffee Cart Rewards Management System Project Vision

### Project Mission: 

Produce a simple, useful, and high-quality management system for the *LameDucks* coffee shop. The system will allow customer purchases to be tracked, with the customer eventually being rewarded with special benefits once they have accrued a certain number of points on their VIP Card, which will be issued on their first purchase. 

##### 1. Customers and benefits

**Customers:**

 - Atlanta coffee lovers who work and live nearby the various coffee cart locations served by *LameDucks*.
 - The employees and owners of *LameDucks*.
 
**Benefits:**
 
 - The system will automatically keep track of a customer's purchases and points.
 - The system will be able to quickly generate useful reports (e.g. Daily Items Purchased, Daily Items Pre-Ordered, etc.)
 - The system will automatically apply VIP Discounts for GOLD level customers.
 - The system will maintain contact information for customers, and allow for additional marketing, outreach or customer relationship opportunities in the future.
 
##### 2. Key factors used to judge quality

 - The system must be easy to use.
 - The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.
 - The system must fulfill all of the requirements presented for the project.
