# Risk Assessment

Performing a risk assessment is an important step in being prepared for potential problems that can occur during the development of the project. During the risk assessment, if a potential risk is identified, a solution or plan of action should be developed. The following is a list of potential project risks. Each risk that receives a high score should have a corresponding plan for management and control of the risk. The criteria that are applied when selecting the appropriate risk level are as follows:

 - **Low** - Very unlikely that this will occur during the development of the project
 - **Medium** - There is a 50/50 chance that this will occur during the development of the project
 - **High** - Very likely that this will occur during the development of the project

## Possible Risks

1. The hardware or software chosen to do the project can't handle the workload required to complete the project. **(Low Risk)**
2. The cost of labor, support costs and other charges aren't within the budget and will increase year to year. **(Low Risk)**
3. We do not have enough resources / manpower and the project team members aren't in place when required. **(Medium Risk)**
4. The requirements have not been gathered and defined adequately. **(Low Risk)**
5. The requirements are continually changing. **(Low Risk)**
6. The project will not be completed on time. **(Medium Risk)**
7. There is no correct platform for testing and modeling. **(Medium Risk)**
8. The system requires continuous maintenance and debugging. **(Low Risk)**
9. The project has not been planned carefully and does not have a vision document. **(Low Risk)**
10. We do not have experienced team members and the work has not been divided correctly. **(Medium Risk)**
11. The user interface is not correct, clear, and easy to use. **(Medium Risk)**
12.  The system is affected when more customers are added as members. **(Medium Risk)**
13.  The compilers or code generators available are not appropriate for the system to be built. **(Low Risk)**
14. The testing tools available are not appropriate for the system to be built. **(Medium Risk)**
15. The formal technical reviews of test procedures and test cases are not conducted regularly. **(Medium Risk)**
16. A delay in one deliverable causes cascading delays in the completion of the project. **(High Risk)**
17.  The compilers or code generators available are not appropriate for the product to be built. **(Low Risk)**
18. The software configuration management tools are not available. **(Low Risk)**
19. The End-user input is not solicited, causing ultimate failure of the product and to meet user expectations. **(Low Risk)**
20. The requirements demand the use of new analysis, design, or testing methods and  use of unconventional software development methods? **(Low Risk)**
