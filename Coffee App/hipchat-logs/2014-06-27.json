During the risk assessment, if a potential risk is identified, a solution or plan of action should be developed. The following is a list of potential project risks. Each risk that receives a high score should have a corresponding plan for management and control of the risk. The criteria that are applied when selecting the appropriate risk level are as follows:\\n\\nLow - Very unlikely that this will occur during the development of the project\\n\\nMedium - There is a 50 - 50 chance that this will occur during the development of the project\\n\\nHigh - Very likely that this will occur during the development of the project\\n\\n\\n1.

The main thing I think would be to go ahead and checkout a fresh clone of the repository:\\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/gt-ud-softeng\/cs6300-summer-team22\\ngit checkout Deliverable1\\n\\nSince you would be starting at that point you should have the latest copy at that time. However, afterwards, there's always the chance someone might have committed something so you may want to pull down any changes first before doing anything else:\\ngit pull origin Deliverable1\\n\\nplace your file in the Deliverable1 in-progress folder (the ArgoUML one)\\nthen:\\ngit add 6300Sum14Project2\/Deliverable1\/in-progress\/YourFileName\\ngit commit -m \"Adding the Use Case Model Original\"\\n\\nAfter the commit then:\\ngit push origin Deliverable1"
