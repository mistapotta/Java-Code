Additionally they mention we can add additional tests if we want to (we won't be penalized for not doing so if we don't need\/want to though). Aside from that and additional code cleanup\/commenting type work today, the main thing is getting the GUI working and the tests passing for it again. Then we can decide if we want to implement Task 3 or not for the extra credit ;-)."
